# Handoff

- roadmap_item: `doc` (minimal) and the reference generator, pulled forward from Phase 3 (ADR 0012, OQ-11)
- status: in-progress            <!-- in-progress | waiting-ci | waiting-owner -->
- lock_until: 2026-10-21T20:05:37Z
- last_update: 2026-10-21T18:35:37Z

## Done

- Step 1 done: `doc` uses `hecate.json`, internal codec and its test removed (tests, lint, boundaries pass).
- Claimed. #25 (`json`) is merged; `doc` already has a first slice (renderer, site model, theme, search, reference generator).

- Step 2 done: `SystemFileSystem` over `reactor.fs` (OQ-33 b); runners and tests run inside `reactor.run`; theme files read with `io`; deps/README/rockspec/CLAUDE.md updated; unit and integration tests, lint, boundaries, rockspecs pass.

- Resumed after CI failure (logs not downloadable: blob host blocked by proxy). Merged main (#26 SHA pins); all local gates and full test pass. Pushed to re-run CI; if still red, diagnose from the Actions UI.

## Next steps

1. Integrate the ADR 0022 native module (comrak, syntect) in steps (needs the Rust toolchain; check `cargo` is available).
2. Reference pages for `core` and `reactor`; website built by `doc` in CI.

## Decisions taken (and where they are recorded)

## Commands to re-run
