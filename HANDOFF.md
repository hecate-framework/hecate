# Handoff

- roadmap_item: **Phase 1 gate**: verification of the phase, as described in Phase gates. Open questions to put to the owner before Phase 2: OQ-50, OQ-47, OQ-23, OQ-24, OQ-26 (1) and OQ-22.
- status: waiting-owner
- lock_until: 2026-10-27T11:20:00Z
- last_update: 2026-10-27T11:20:00Z

## Done

- Claimed the gate (PR #40 merged, benchmarks item ticked).
- Ran all check tasks, build-native json/doc, full test, bench tcp-echo: all ok. Wrote docs/reviews/phase-1.md (coherence pending).
- Cloud tip: run `eval "$(luarocks path)"` before `test`, else luv is not found.

## Next steps

0. Coherence audit done in three raw parts (docs/reviews/_phase-1-part-{A,B,C}.md: 45+32+27 findings). Next: owner answers on the D items and the six OQs; then fix the small findings in this PR, merge the parts into phase-1-coherence-findings.md, update phase-1.md section 3, run /review-package. DONE earlier: sections 1, 2, 4 of docs/reviews/phase-1.md. Remaining: section 3 coherence audit (file by file, as phase-0-coherence-findings.md) and /review-package on core, reactor, net, json, log, doc; then owner decisions on OQ-50/47/23/24/26/22 (issue opened); then tick the gate and delete this file.

1. Completeness: read every ticked Phase 1 item against its spec and the definition of done.
2. It works: run the check catalogue, native builds, tests, examples, benchmarks; read CI of latest main.
3. Coherence: docs, ADRs, README, website en/fr, llms.txt.
4. Write docs/reviews/phase-1.md; update docs/open-questions.md; open/update needs-decision issue.
